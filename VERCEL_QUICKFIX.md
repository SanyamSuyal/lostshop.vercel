# Vercel Quick Fix Guide

## Fix for "The pattern "api/index.js" doesn't match any Serverless Functions" error

Follow these steps to quickly fix your Vercel deployment:

### Step 1: Update your vercel.json

Replace your current vercel.json with this simplified version:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/index.js", "use": "@vercel/node" },
    { "src": "client/**", "use": "@vercel/static" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.js" },
    { "src": "/health", "dest": "/api/index.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/client/$1" }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

To do this, run:
```
cp vercel-simplified.json vercel.json
```

### Step 2: Ensure api/index.js exists and is correctly formatted

The api/index.js file has been created with a minimal serverless function.

### Step 3: Run the vercel.sh script (optional)

For a complete setup with test files:
```
./vercel.sh
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

```
vercel
```

### Step 5: Test the deployment

After deployment, check these endpoints:
- https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test
- https://your-app.vercel.app/health

Both should return JSON responses if working correctly.

## Additional Help

If you're still experiencing issues, try:

1. Verifying your project structure (run `ls -la api/` to confirm api/index.js exists)
2. Checking Vercel build logs for specific errors
3. Ensuring your repository is properly synced with Vercel

Remember to set your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
- DATABASE_URL (with sslmode=require for Neon PostgreSQL)
- SESSION_SECRET
- Any other required environment variables

## Next Steps

After fixing the deployment, integrate your full application by:

1. Building your client with `cd client && npx vite build`
2. Building your server with esbuild
3. Committing and deploying again
