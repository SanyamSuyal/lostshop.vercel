# Fixing the 404 Error on Vercel Deployment

## The Problem

The 404 error (with ID like `bom1::6z5xg-1744032907168-a1aff61a8540`) occurs because Vercel is unable to properly route requests to your application. This happens because:

1. Your application is a full-stack app with both server and client components
2. The default Vercel deployment process doesn't handle this setup correctly
3. The build command was failing to properly generate the dist directory

## The Solution

I've made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. Created a custom build script (`vercel.sh`) that correctly builds both client and server
2. Updated `vercel.json` to use this custom build script
3. Set the output directory to the correct location
4. Added proper routing configuration for both API endpoints and static assets
5. Specified the deployment region to match what you're seeing in the error (bom1)

## Steps to Deploy

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Ensure the following environment variables are set in your Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (correctly formatted)
   - `SESSION_SECRET`
   - Any other secrets your app needs
3. Deploy again - it should work correctly this time

## If the Error Persists

Try these additional steps:

1. Delete the previous deployment entirely
2. Create a new project in Vercel
3. Connect to your repository
4. Set all environment variables
5. Deploy fresh

## Checking Logs

When troubleshooting, check the Vercel deployment logs carefully for any build or runtime errors.
