# Vercel Deployment Guide for Your Full-Stack Application

## 404 Error - What's Happening

The 404 error (NOT_FOUND) you're seeing is because Vercel can't correctly route the requests to your server and static files. This happens because your application is a full-stack app with both a Node.js backend and a Vite/React frontend.

## Deployment Solution

I've updated your vercel.json configuration to handle this. The key changes include:

1. Using separate build configurations for client and server
2. Setting up proper routing for static assets
3. Ensuring API requests are properly directed to the server

## Required Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in your Vercel project dashboard:

1. DATABASE_URL - Must be formatted as: `postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database?sslmode=require`
2. SESSION_SECRET - A secure random string for session encryption
3. NODE_ENV - Set to "production"
4. VERCEL - Set to "1"

## Deployment Checklist

1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. Create a new deployment in Vercel
3. Connect to your repository
4. Set all required environment variables
5. Deploy

## Alternative (If Vercel Still Doesn't Work)

Consider using Railway.app which has better support for full-stack Node.js apps:

1. Sign up for Railway
2. Create a new project
3. Connect to your Git repository
4. Add a PostgreSQL database
5. Set the same environment variables
6. Deploy

## Testing The Deployment

After deployment, verify these work:
- Frontend routes (/, /dashboard, etc.)
- API endpoints (/api/user, etc.)
- Database connections
